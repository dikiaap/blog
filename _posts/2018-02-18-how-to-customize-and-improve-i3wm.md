I set [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) to have more functions and I need that to get a better user experience. I need a launcher, notification, bar, and the icons that are simple and can be customized.

## Workspaces
When I open the app, I organize them into different workspaces and sort the apps that are related to each other.

<b>Workspace 1: Terminal</b><br>
Most i3wm users set their first Workspace is for Terminal. It makes it easy for i3 users because most of them often use Terminal for the first time entering the window manager.

<b>Workspace 2: Editor and IDE</b><br>
I put Editor and IDE in the second Workspace because it is close to Terminal and easy to switch.

<b>Workspace 3: Browser</b><br>
Workspace `3` is for Browser, related to Workspace `1` and `2` when I do coding.

<b>Workspace 4: Files</b><br>
File Manager is my 4th priority to Workspace `4`, because this apps is often used following previous workspaces.

<b>Workspace 5: Documents</b><br>
I love writing things, so I put them here.

<b>Workspace 6: Media</b><br>
This is for media like music and video. I use Workspace `6` because the word of Mu<i>sic</i>.

<b>Workspace 7: Design</b><br>
This Workspace is for stuff like `GIMP`, `Inkscape`, etc. I put it in the middle of workspace and because I rarely used it.

<b>Workspace 8: Chat</b><br>
This is a somewhat far away workspace and most of the workspace around here is _bored_, so I send it here to make a noise.

<b>Workspace 9: General (Random Apps)</b><br>
This Workspace is may be for an important or slightly important or unimportant apps that I don't know where to put it.

<b>Workspace 10: Settings</b><br>
This workspace is for controlling my OS, such as Desktop Preferences, Default Applications, Keyboard and Mouse, Monitor Settings, Power Manager, and more.
